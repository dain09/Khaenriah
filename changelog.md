Khaenriah Project v2.8 - Celestial Edict
for Realme 5 Pro (RMX1971)

=======================
Welcome to the Khaenriah Project, where you get more than just a fast and stable kernelâ€”you get a complete and intelligent control framework for your device. This project is designed to give you the power and flexibility to customize your phone's performance with unparalleled ease, all through a powerful terminal interface.
### Core Philosophy
The goal of the Khaenriah Project has evolved beyond just high benchmark scores. It's about creating a "Sentient" experience where the kernel adapts to your usage, gives you a suite of tools for total control when you need it, and works silently in the background to optimize battery life when you don't. This isn't just a kernel; it's an integrated performance management system.
### Key Features
The Khaenriah Tweak Engine: The heart of the project. Instead of relying on complex third-party apps, you can control everything directly from a simple and intuitive terminal interface, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly.
Finely-Tuned Performance Profiles: Comes with 7 pre-configured profiles designed to meet all your needs, from hardcore gaming to maximum battery saving.
Intelligent "Adaptive" Profile with a dedicated App Manager: The flagship feature of the engine. It automatically detects games and heavy apps (from a list you manage) to boost performance on the fly, and returns to a power-saving state when you're done. You now have full control over which apps get this boost.
New "Gaming+" Profile: An extreme performance mode designed for the most demanding games that need every bit of the device's power.
Integrated Terminal Toolkit:
Live Performance Monitor: View CPU & GPU frequencies, temperature, and memory usage in real-time.
Benchmarking Tool: Start a recording session, play your game, then stop it to get a detailed report on average performance and peak temperatures.
CPU Frequency Tuner: Set a maximum frequency limit for the big and little CPU clusters to suit your needs.
Memory Management Tools: Clean caches, drop RAM caches, and forcefully kill background apps.
Backup & Restore: Export all your settings (profiles, game list, etc.) into a single file and import them easily.
Thermal Safety Net: Even when thermal controls are disabled in high-performance profiles, the engine monitors temperatures in the background and automatically re-enables throttling if they exceed safe limits, protecting your device.
Automatic Deep Sleep Mode: When the screen is off, the kernel automatically enters an ultra power-saving mode to preserve battery life during idle periods.
### Understanding the Performance Profiles
You can access and manage all features by typing dain or khaenriah in any terminal app after gaining root access (su).
1) Gaming+ (Extreme):
What it does: Unleashes the maximum possible power from the CPU and GPU with aggressive tweaks. It disables system thermal throttling to deliver consistent, sustained performance.
Best for: The world's most demanding games (e.g., Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves) that need extreme performance.
Warning: This mode consumes significant battery and generates heat. Use it wisely.
2) Gaming:
What it does: Provides very high and stable performance. Disables system thermal throttling.
Best for: Long and intense gaming sessions that demand the absolute best performance (e.g., COD: Mobile, PUBG).
3) Performance:
What it does: Similar to Gaming mode, but tuned to achieve the highest possible scores in benchmarking applications.
Best for: Users who want to test the limits of their hardware.
4) Balanced:
What it does: The perfect balance between smooth performance and good battery consumption. Ideal for daily tasks like social media, browsing, and general app usage.
Best for: Most users, most of the time.
5) Battery:
What it does: Focuses entirely on maximizing battery life. It limits the CPU speed and applies aggressive power-saving settings.
Best for: When you're running low on battery and need your phone to last as long as possible.
6) Adaptive (Recommended):
What it does: The smartest profile of all. In normal use, it behaves like the Balanced profile. However, as soon as you launch a game or app from your custom list, it automatically applies the profile you've assigned to it. When you exit the app, it seamlessly returns to normal.
Best for: The user who wants the best of both worlds: great performance when needed and great battery life otherwise, all without manual intervention.
7) Custom:
What it does: This is your personal playground. This profile applies the settings you've configured yourself using the "Edit Custom Profile" option.
Best for: Advanced users who know what they're doing and want their own personalized setup.
### Changelog
v2.7 - Stellar Terminus
[FIXED] Fixed a critical bug causing camera freezes in apps like WhatsApp by removing the aggressive 'Enhanced Idle Mode'. System stability is now prioritized.
[FIXED] Fixed a parsing bug that showed '{' or '}' characters before or after package names in the UI.
[IMPROVED] Greatly improved the reliability of app detection by creating a more robust system UI ignore list (fixes the notification shade issue again, for good).
v2.6 - Elysian Requiem
[FIXED] The App Profile Manager now updates the list instantly after any change, fixing the visual bug.
[REMOVED] Fully removed the 'Focus Mode' (DND) feature for a more streamlined experience.
[IMPROVED] The 'Profile Hunter' has been upgraded to a full 'App Profile Manager', allowing you to view, edit, and delete apps from your list.
[IMPROVED] Added more helpful notifications for profile changes and critical battery levels.
(For older changelogs, please refer to previous releases.)
