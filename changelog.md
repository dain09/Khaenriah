 Khaenriah Kernel v1.1 - Sentient Edition

 for Realme 5 Pro (RMX1971)

 by Abdallah Ibrahim (@D_ai_n)

=======================



where you get more than just a fast and stable kernelâ€”you get a complete, intelligent control experience for your device. This project was designed to provide the power and flexibility to customize your phone's performance with unparalleled ease.



### ### Core Philosophy



The goal of Khaenriah Kernel is to deliver more than just high benchmark scores. It's about creating a "Sentient" experience where the kernel adapts to your usage, gives you the tools for total control when you need it, and works quietly in the background to optimize battery life when you don't.

### ### Key Features



1. **Optimized Kernel Base:** Built upon the latest available sources, with specific optimizations for performance, stability, and battery life on the Realme 5 Pro.



2. **The Sentient Tweak Engine:** This is the heart of the project. Instead of relying on complex third-party apps, you can control everything directly from a simple and intuitive terminal interface.



3. **Finely-Tuned Performance Profiles:** Comes with 6 pre-configured profiles designed to meet all your needs, from hardcore gaming to maximum battery saving.



4. **Intelligent "Adaptive" Profile:** The flagship feature of the engine. It automatically detects games and heavy apps to boost performance on the fly, and returns to a power-saving state when you're done.



5. **Thermal Safety Net:** Even when thermal controls are disabled in high-performance profiles, the engine monitors temperatures in the background and automatically re-enables throttling if they exceed safe limits, protecting your device.



6. **Automatic Deep Sleep Mode:** When the screen is off, the kernel automatically enters an ultra power-saving mode to preserve battery life during idle periods.



### ### Understanding the Performance Profiles



You can access and manage all features by typing `dain` or `khaenriah` in any terminal app after gaining root access (su).



*  **1) Gaming:**

  *  **What it does:** Unleashes the maximum power of the CPU and GPU. It disables system thermal throttling to deliver consistent, sustained performance.

  *  **Best for:** Long and intense gaming sessions that demand the absolute best performance.

  *  **Warning:** This mode consumes significant battery and generates heat. Use it wisely.



*  **2) Performance:**

  *  **What it does:** Similar to Gaming mode, but tuned to achieve the highest possible scores in benchmarking applications.

  *  **Best for:** Users who want to test the limits of their hardware.



*  **3) Dynamic (Balanced):**

  *  **What it does:** The perfect balance between smooth performance and good battery consumption. Ideal for daily tasks like social media, browsing, and general app usage.

  *  **Best for:** Most users, most of the time.



*  **4) Battery:**

  *  **What it does:** Focuses entirely on maximizing battery life. It underclocks the CPU and applies aggressive power-saving settings.

  *  **Best for:** When you're running low on battery and need your phone to last as long as possible.



*  **5) Custom:**

  *  **What it does:** This is your personal playground. This profile applies the settings you've configured yourself using the "Edit Custom Profile" option.

  *  **Best for:** Advanced users who know what they're doing and want their own personalized setup.



*  **6) Adaptive (Recommended):**

  *  **What it does:** The smartest profile of all. In normal use, it behaves like the Dynamic profile. However, as soon as you launch a game from your custom list, it automatically engages a "light performance boost" to enhance your gaming experience. When you exit the game, it seamlessly returns to normal.

  *  **Best for:** The user who wants the best of both worlds: great performance when needed and great battery life otherwise, all without manual intervention.



### ### Changelog
